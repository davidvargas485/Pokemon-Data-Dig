# Pokemon-Data-Dig

### In this SQL Project, I'm querying a dataset of the first 6 generations of pokemon to discover interesting statistics. Pokemon was a major part of my childhood and I still am a fan today. Below are some of my key findings!

Please take a look at the data visualizations I created from my various query results <https://github.com/davidvargas485/Pokemon-Data-Dig/tree/main/Data%20Visuals>
