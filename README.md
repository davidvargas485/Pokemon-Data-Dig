# Pokemon-Data-Dig

## Description
In this SQL Project, I'm querying a dataset of the first 6 generations of pokemon to discover interesting bits of information. Specifically, I focus on learning more about the strongest Pokemon, the various Pokemon generations, the many Pokemon types, and the legendary Pokemon population.  Pokemon was a major part of my childhood and I still am a fan today! *This project focuses on the base forms of the first 721 pokemon only.* 

**Please take a look at the data visualizations I created from my various query results by clicking [here](https://github.com/davidvargas485/Pokemon-Data-Dig/tree/main/Data%20Visuals).**
